## Sorting and Searching Algorithms Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of various sorting and searching algorithms in Java, along with an analysis of their running times on datasets of varying sizes.

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Counting Sort**
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### Description
This project was undertaken as a part of the BBM204 Programming Assignment 1 for the Spring 2024 semester of BBM204 Software Laboratory II course. The goal was to implement sorting and searching algorithms and analyze their running times on datasets of changing sizes.

### Implementation
The implemented algorithms are available in the `Main.java` file. Each algorithm is thoroughly implemented and tested.

### Analysis
The analysis involves:
- Determining the time required for each basic operation.
- Identifying unknown quantities describing the frequency of execution of basic operations.
- Developing a realistic model for the input data.
- Analyzing the unknown quantities assuming the modeled input.
- Calculating the total running time by multiplying the time by the frequency for each operation and adding all the products.

### Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is stored in the file `TrafficFlowDataset.csv`.

### Instructions
To run the analysis, execute the `main` method in the `Main.java` file. Ensure that the `TrafficFlowDataset.csv` file is present in the project directory.

### Results
The results of the analysis are visualized using charts generated by the `showAndSaveChart` method in `Main.java`. The charts depict the running times of the algorithms for different input sizes.

For further details, refer to the source code and the accompanying documentation within the repository.
